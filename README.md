### Hello | Willkommen | Salvete

I am a computer science graduate student at SUNY New Paltz.
Besides being a history and math nerd, I enjoy web development and java software programming!

:telescope: I am currently working on...
- advance data structures such as AVL Trees in my Java programming class
- principles of an e-business website on a PHP server

:octocat: Website: Please check out my [portfolio website](https://oriordac.github.io/portfolio-site/).

:zap: Fun fact: I paint mosaic-esque pointillism paintings.
